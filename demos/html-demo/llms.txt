jsondiffpatch is an npm package.
it compares 2 json (or any 2 objects in javascript or typescript), and get a json diff with the changes.

``` ts
import { diff } from "jsondiffpatch";

const delta = diff(left, right);
```

## features

- deep diff json or objects, get a compact json diff delta
- use delta to patch
- smart array diffing using [LCS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem), **_IMPORTANT NOTE:_** to match objects inside an array you must provide an `objectHash` function (this is how objects are matched, otherwise a dumb match by position is used). For more details, check [Array diff documentation](docs/arrays.md)
- multiple formatters (visual html, jsonpatch, console)
- (optionally) uses [google-diff-match-patch](http://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/) for long text diffs (diff at character level)
- reverse a delta, unpatch (eg. revert object to its original state using a delta)
- simplistic, pure JSON, low footprint [delta format](docs/deltas.md)
- multiple output formatters:
  - html (check it at the [Live Demo](https://jsondiffpatch.com))
  - annotated json (html), makes the JSON delta format self-explained
  - console (colored), try running `./node_modules/.bin/jsondiffpatch left.json right.json`
  - JSON Patch format RFC 6902 support
  - write your own! check [Formatters documentation](docs/formatters.md)
- BONUS: `jsondiffpatch.clone(obj)` (deep clone)
